      call-to-ldconfig and package-name-doesnt-match-sonames warnings.
    - debian/rules, debian/control: Added chrpath to Build-Depends and
      deleting all rpath info with chrpath in install-arch target. This
      fixes all binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath warnings.
  * debian/rules: Adjusted target dependencies to be more sane. Renamed
    "test" target to "check".
  * Applied a patch by Adam Powell IV that adds /usr/lib/libmpi++.so via
    update-alternatives for compatibility with LAM/MPI and MPICH. Thanks to
    Adam for the patch! (Closes: #459642)

    lack of upstream support for atomistic operations on the other 
    architectures (c.f. Debian BTS for openmpi)

openmpi (1.1-2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * 0-day alpha porter upload.
  * Fix wrong inline assembler check on alpha: 'zero' is not recognized
    as a mnemonic for $31 with binutils.  This broken check resulted
    in various atomic operations remaining undefined, leading to a build
    failure on alpha.  Likewise, fix the inline assembly provided in
    opal/include/opal/sys/alpha/atomic.h so that it's valid under GNU
    binutils.  Closes: #384792.
